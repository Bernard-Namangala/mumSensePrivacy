  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

  <p>MumSense ("we," "our," or "us") operates the MumSense mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name and email address.</p>
  <p><strong>Receipt Data:</strong> When you scan receipts using your device's camera, we process the receipt image to extract purchase information such as store name, item names, quantities, and prices. Receipt images are processed and not permanently stored as images on our servers.</p>
  <p><strong>Spending & Budget Data:</strong> We store your extracted purchase data to provide spending analysis, budget tracking, price comparisons, and savings insights.</p>
  <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> We access your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning grocery receipts. We do not capture photos or video for any other purpose.</p>
  <p><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> If you enable push notifications, we collect your device's push notification token to send you relevant alerts about savings, deals, and community activity.</p>
  <p><strong>Community Data:</strong> If you participate in community features (bulk buys, chat, trolley sharing), we store the content you share with other users.</p>
  <p><strong>Investment Simulation Data:</strong> If you use the investment learning features, we store your simulated portfolio and trade history. No real financial transactions are made.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the App's core features (receipt scanning, spending tracking, budget management)</li>
    <li>To generate personalized savings insights and price comparison recommendations</li>
    <li>To facilitate community features such as bulk buying, chat, and trolley sharing</li>
    <li>To provide investment education through simulated portfolio features</li>
    <li>To send push notifications about savings opportunities, community activity, and app updates (with your permission)</li>
    <li>To improve and optimize the App's performance and user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. AI-Powered Analysis</h2>
  <p>We use artificial intelligence services (including OpenAI) to analyze your receipt data and generate spending insights, detect product brands and categories, and provide personalized recommendations. Your data is processed securely and is not used to train third-party AI models.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services that help us operate the App (cloud hosting, AI processing, push notification delivery)</li>
    <li><strong>Community Features:</strong> Information you voluntarily share in community features (trolleys, bulk buys, chat messages) is visible to other users</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored on secure cloud servers. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and download your personal data</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
    <li>Opt out of push notifications at any time through the App's notification settings</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent for data processing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Subscription & Payments</h2>
  <p>Subscription payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not directly collect or store your payment card information. Please refer to Apple's or Google's privacy policies for payment data handling.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
